# Rate-My-Sitter

## **Overview**
Rate-My-Sitter is an app that allows parents to connect with other parents and babysitters. Parents can post jobs and connect with babysitters through reviews and recommendations. Rate-My-Sitter is a safe place for parents to express concerns and find people they trust when it comes to childcare.

Rate-My-Sitter was founded February of 2020 and is brought to you by a dedicated group of developers who aim to give you the best experience at finding a responsible person to take care of the ones you love. We also give the oppurtunity for a sitter to find a job and be reviewed to enhance their qualifications and place them in the perfect position for everyone. We are always making room for improvement and hope to add features so you can find sitters for not just your babies but your furbabies as well. We aim to find something for everyone and are always open to suggestions. We hope this site will find the right person for you.
